Make custom Sonic 3 Blue Sphere levels

This is a side project I decided to work on for the better part of two weeks, and I'd say it's not too bad considering the time frame. This game lets you create and play stages in the Blue Sphere style from Sonic the Hedgehog 3! Hope you enjoy~

If you're interested, here are a few things I feel are lacking about my setup (and I may/may not fix them eventually...):

- Once or twice I've encountered some objects in random, invalid spots. This only ever happened with one level so far, but it's really weird...
- The objects approach you according to some obnoxious polynomial regression functions I used. It's not ideal, and leads to a slight bit of jank as the objects approach you in the middle row.
- The scaled sprites from the Genesis also took perspective into account, where here the sprites are simply scaled directly based on distance. This is most noticeable with the Chaos Emerald
- I sorta wanted to make a custom palette maker, but I really can't be asked right now. Enjoy two of my own, though! (Palette 8 and 9)
- The red star bumpers are a bit weird, since they sometimes let you turn on them in the original game. This one is a bit inconsistent, but it tends to work...?

If you use Godot, feel free to try your hand at improving it!
